  abstractnote = {Telemetry data, sent by the satellite, is the only
                  basis for ground staffs to monitor on-board
                  equipment status. In addition, the pattern discovery
                  and operating state identification of telemetry data
                  are very essential for automatic anomaly detection
                  and problem diagnosis for satellites. Clustering, as
                  an important data mining method for time series, can
                  realize pattern discovery of satellite telemetry
                  data automatically and intelligently, whereas the
                  large amount of raw data and pseudo-period
                  characteristic make the clustering on raw data
                  inefficient and susceptible to noise
                  interference. Thus, based on the prominent shape
                  features and Time-Spatial specialty, a clustering
                  framework is proposed for telemetry data mining with
                  physical-based segmentation and improved time series
                  representation. Moreover, different distance
                  measures are introduced to this framework to realize
                  the time series clustering. The experiments are
                  firstly performed on the public data sets which have
                  high similarity with the real satellite telemetry to
                  quantify the clustering accuracy, then a case study
                  on the real satellite telemetry verifies the
                  effectiveness and applicability of the proposed
                  framework.},
